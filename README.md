## Description: 
We will be analyzing the occurrence of mental illness across the United States, and how that occurrence varies by gender and socioeconomic status. Using that data, we will incorporate how ease of access to healthcare and the amount of government expenditure on mental health programs and resources affects suicide and crime rates in relation to mental illness incidence. 

## Questions:
* What are the top diagnoses of mental illness across U.S. regions (breakdown by demographics such as age, gender, race & ethnicity, household income)?

* How accessible is treatment/counseling in these areas (i.e., licensed mental health providers, mental health facilities)?

* What is the relationship between these top mental illnesses, mental healthcare access, and suicide rates & suicide attempt rates?

## Breakdown of Tasks:
* Define mental health/illness
* Gather data showing occurrence of mental illness across the world
* Gather data showing occurrence of mental illness by gender per country
* Gather data showing occurrence of mental illness by socioeconomic status per country
* Gather data showing ease/lack of access and availability to healthcare
    * Number of doctors, hospitals, health programs, etc, per country
* Gather data showing amount of money spent by each countryâ€™s government on mental illness treatment/help
* Gather data showing suicide rate per country, also by gender and socioeconomic status
* Gather data showing crime rate per country, also by gender and socioeconomic status
